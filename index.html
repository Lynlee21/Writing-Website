            <p>
              Luke is next in line to take her father's place as leader of the
              shapeshifter pack at Mason. She's learned a lot about running a
              Pack, but she doesn't know if she's ready to lead yet.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It doesn't help matters that the pack is being attacked by unknown
              forces-attacks that have taken many, including Luke's human
              mother, and are now threatening to wipe out the pack entirely.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With no other choice, Alpha Gray reaches out to a nearby town, and
              Luke finds out that help can come in more ways than one. Now, she
              has to navigate a love life she wasn't looking for, as well as
              keeping her pack alive.

            <h3 class="mb-3">Project Mercy</h3>
            <p>
              Mercy only wanted to follow in her father's footsteps and fly for
              the military. So far, she'd been able to do that, successfully
              hiding the fact that she was a magic user, something that could
              land her in prison. She never expected to handpicked by the base's
              newest dragon transfer, Andryn. Then she falls for the new
              recruit, who also happens to be her new partner.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now, Mercy's trying to reign in her feelings for Joon, and trying
              to reign in her magic as the military higher ups begin to focus
              their attention on her. Which will win, her love for flying, or
              her love for Joon?
